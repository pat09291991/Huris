                    world, organizations, in order to survive & prosper, need to transform towards a shared sense of the
                    future, an agile & proactive mindset & people who are prepared to create rather than wait for the
                    future. In such an environment, adaptability, creativity and speed are the pathways to survival and
                    success. Organizations, therefore need to be constantly self-transforming, even to the extent of
                    creating new rules for effectiveness & success.</p>

                <p class="pContext" style="margin-top: 0px;">An emerging discipline called Organization Development is
                    an approach that aims to develop and align organizational capabilities to support corporate growth.
                    I had the privilege of growing professionally with this discipline and I would view Organization
                    Development (OD) as a philosophy and a strategy of leveraging the power of organization purpose,
                    processes and people to develop the internal capabilities required to sustain the value creation
                    process of the enterprise amidst the realities of constant changes</p>

                <p class="pContext">Creating an adaptive, learning organization is a key capability for surviving in
                    today’s fast-changing environment. An adaptive learning organization consists of three interacting
                    core components: 1) Purpose; 2) Processes; 3) People.
                </p>
                <p class="pContext">Successful organizations are driven by clear, inspiring and shared meaning as to its
                    basic purpose, mission and values.</p>
                <p class="pContext">The component of Purpose refers not only to written documents on vision, mission and
                    core values which man companies post on their walls but more importantly to a shared mindset of
                    every member of the organization on its strategic directions and priorities. These strategic
                    directions, when fully internalized, guide members of the organization to effective behaviors and
                    outcomes.</p>
                <p class="pContext">Processes on the other hand, are the execution enablers translating the strategic
                    directions towards sustained and consistent results.</p>
                <p class="pContext">The third component, People, is the key to making the two aforementioned components.
                    Work. The power of the people component lies on the quality and commitment of employees of the firm,
                    energized by its leadership & people policies</p>
                <p class="pContext">Integrating these three components in a way that initiatives commitment and embeds
                    these capabilities into the overall competence of the organizational is the challenge of the OD
                    practice. Specifically these organizational capabilities may consist if the following: inspiring
                    leadership, flawless customer service, a shared mindset on mission and values, a learning and
                    customer-driven culture, among others</p>

                    <p class="pSubTitle" style="margin-top: 40px;">Whole System Transformation</p>
                    <p class="pContext" style="margin-top: 0px;">In this article, I will share a summary of a ten-step
                        OD methodology for Whole System Transformation (WST) developed by Roland Sullivan. It is derived
                        from his experiences over the last 40 years with over 1,000 organizations, ranging from 100 to
                        140,000 employees. I would like to acknowledge the kind permission given by Sullivan and his
                        associate, Mary Jane B. Balasi to edit their article published in Development and Learning
                        Organizations of Emerald Insight and selected by its editorial board as the Outstanding Paper of
                        2014</p>
                    <p class="pSubTitle" style="margin-top: 40px;">Essential 1. Build Internal Change Agent Capability
                    </p>
                    <p class="pContext" style="margin-top: 0px;">A highly competent Internal Change Agent (ICA) using a
                        proven OD methodology is key. He / she is positioned to facilitate the change process while the
                        executive leadership controls the content.
                        The external WST consultant provides coaching to transfer the knowledge to the internal change
                        agent. The external consultant works with the client system ICA and senior leaders to set up the
                        structure process, and political relationships to support change.</p>
                    <p class="pSubTitle" style="margin-top: 40px;">Essential 2. Transform the Executive Team
                    </p>
                    <p class="pContext" style="margin-top: 0px;">The first intervention in a whole system transformation
                        effort ideally focuses on the CEO’s team. The Executive Team defines the process that will be
                        used to transform the whole system under them. In order to achieve this, the Executive Team must
                        be transformed first i.e. have one brain and one heart, which sets the tone for system-wide
                        change.</p>
                    <p class="pContext" style="margin-top: 0px;">Modeling change at the top has the best chance of
                        inspiring the rest to embrace change and gain trust and commitment. Each executive in the top
                        team must transform themselves, as well as the executive team’s effectiveness as a group, for
                        system-wide change to happen. This helps them understand the way they relate intra-personally,
                        to each other, the system and others.</p>

                    <p class="pSubTitle" style="margin-top: 40px;">Essential 3. Develop the Transformation Design Team
                    </p>
                    <p class="pContext" style="margin-top: 0px;">The first intervention in a whole system transformation
                        effort ideally focuses on the CEO’s team. The Executive Team defines the process that will be
                        used to transform the whole system under them. In order to achieve this, the Executive Team must
                        be transformed first i.e. have one brain and one heart, which sets the tone for system-wide
                        change.</p>
                    <p class="pSubTitle" style="margin-top: 40px;">Conclusion:
                    </p>
                    <p class="pContext" style="margin-top: 0px;">In sum, WST is a complex OD journey made simple by
                        practices and theories developed and integrated into a single approach that enables and empowers
                        human talent in organizations to accomplish faster, cheaper, and sustainable positive change. It
                        involves and engages the entire system, allowing ownership of the process (people support what
                        they co-create), suggesting the solutions, and focusing on an aligned rather than segmented
                        change. – See more (Source) at: http://www.jobmarketonline.com/node/13486#sthash.f6PoMDaL.dpuf
